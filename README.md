This repository contains a React project bootstrapped with Vite, a fast and lightweight build tool for modern web development.

## Project Setup

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
     https://github.com/KUSHAL-JAIN-au9/Evotech-assignment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Evotech-assignment
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will launch the development server and open the application in your default browser. The server will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the source code.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```

  |- README.md
```

- The `public` directory contains the main `index.html` file, which serves as the entry point for the application.

- The `src` directory contains the React components, styles, and the main `index.js` file.

- The `components` directory houses the reusable React components used in the application. You can modify and create new components in this directory.
- The `pages` directory houses the main page design containing required reusable component .

- The `main.jsx` file is the entry point for the React application. You can modify this file to add or remove components and configure routing, if necessary.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server and opens the application in your default browser.

- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production. The optimized and minified files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
